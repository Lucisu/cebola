# DEPRECATED

I have started a more robust project with a different structure that produces way better results. It will be published soon.

---

Installation
============

```bash
bash container/start.sh
```

You can access the site on http://localhost:8000/

Login with:
 - user: `admin`
 - password: `secret`

Run the cebola command
======================

```bash
./cebola --plugin plugin-slug
```
This plugin can be the slug as written on wordpress.org
It can be a URL to a zip file.
You can only use local zip files if you provide a valid path within the container.
